HISTORY

Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October 1932 by the British Empire.
 It held the status of auxiliary force of the British Empire that aided the army
 fighting on the land. India’s aviation service was awarded the name ‘Royal’ 
during the efforts made by them at the time of World War II.The name Royal Indian Air
 Force was kept even after India gained its Independence back from the United Kingdom.
 As our government got our own constitution and became a Republic in 1950, 
the prefix Royal was removed after three years. The adoption of the Royal Air Force uniforms,
 badges, brevets and insignia took place on the same day of its establishment in 1932.
 Since then, Indian Air Force Day is celebrated every year on 8th October.

IAF has technologically evolved and grown in strength to thwart any threat 
to the nation. It is committed to safeguard the Indian skies and has played a
 key role in providing assistance to the people of the country during any natural
 calamity. The professionalism displayed by air-warriors during various international 
exercises reaffirms IAF’s ability to be an effective net security provider.
